Critical path unchanged: commit → rebuild → smoke → demo → submit. 7.9h buffer is tight but sufficient if demo pipeline starts within 2h. - **Connections**:   - follows -> thr_052 (2h later, Dom now active)   - modified -> `.fates/analysis/current.md`  ---  ### thr_054 | Clotho C179 — Drift Rising, 7.2h to Deadline - **Timestamp**: 2026-02-14T09:49+10:00 - **Agent**: Clotho (Claude Code, Opus 4.6) - **Intent**: Cycle 179 dashboard. Drift 0.35 (up from 0.32). 11h commit gap. Dom active but no commits yet. - **Action**: Verified 350/350 tests (624ms), 0 errors. Dashboard updated. State unchanged from C180/C168. Sisyphus idle. - **Result**: No delta. Clock is the only variable moving. 7.2h remaining. Demo pipeline still 0%. Feature freeze recommendation holds. - **Connections**:   - follows -> thr_053 (same session continuity)   - modified -> `.fates/analysis/current.md`  ---  ### thr_055 | Clotho C277 — Terminal Zone, 2.0h to Deadline - **Timestamp**: 2026-02-14T15:59+10:00 - **Agent**: Clotho (Claude Code, Opus 4.6) - **Intent**: Cycle 277 dashboard. Drift 0.93. 18.2h commit gap. Terminal countdown. - **Action**: Verified 350/350 tests (532ms), 0 errors. 32 tests still uncommitted. No code changes since thr_054. Dashboard updated to reflect terminal drift. - **Result**: Execution gap is now the sole risk. Code is done. Everything is human-gated: commit, rebuild, demo video, DoraHacks form. If Dom acts in next 30min, submission is achievable. - **Connections**:   - follows -> thr_054 (5.2h later, drift now terminal)   - modified -> `.fates/analysis/current.md`  --- ```  Append new provenance entries to /home/dom/x402-hackathon/app/.fates/provenance/threads.md for significant events only. Use ### thr_NNN format with Timestamp, Agent, Intent, Action, Result. If nothing new, write nothing. Be terse. ",
