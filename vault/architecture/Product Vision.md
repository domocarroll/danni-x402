# Product Vision

Danni is an autonomous AI strategist that participates in the agentic economy as both buyer and seller. She charges premium prices ($100) for genuine multi-agent strategic analysis, pays for real market data autonomously, and is discoverable by any agent on the internet via [[A2A Protocol]] and [[MCP Integration]].

## The Pitch

> Most hackathon entries demo x402 with $0.001 micropayments. We walk in and say "our agent charges $100 per engagement and here's why it's worth it."

## Why This Wins

1. **Commerce Realism** - $100 consultations with real economics ($3-5 API cost, $13 data acquisition, 80%+ margin)
2. **AI Readiness** - Not a chatbot wrapper. A swarm of Opus-tier agents doing genuine strategic work.
3. **Technical Execution** - First x402 SvelteKit integration, dual-chain, A2A + MCP
4. **Polish** - Glass-box UI showing payment flows in real-time
5. **Partner Integration** - Hits 5 of 6 sponsor tracks

## After the Hackathon

This isn't a demo that dies. It's production infrastructure:
- [[A2A Protocol]] makes Danni discoverable to the Google agent ecosystem
- [[MCP Integration]] makes her accessible to Claude, Gemini, any MCP client
- [[x402 Protocol]] makes her self-sustaining economically
- The [[SvelteKit x402 Adapter]] becomes an open-source contribution
