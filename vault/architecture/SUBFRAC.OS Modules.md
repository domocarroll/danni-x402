# SUBFRAC.OS Modules

Danni's brain architecture. These modules emerged from Woz's SUBFRACTURE whitepaper and encode decades of agency experience into executable strategic intelligence. This is the [[Intellectual Property|moat layer]] — the IP that makes Danni irreplaceable.

## /strategy — Strategic Intelligence Engine

**Core thesis:** Uncover hidden market truths and positioning opportunities.

### Four Phases

1. **Context Mapping** — Map market topology, detect hidden truths ("what everyone knows but won't say"), identify customer migration patterns and profit pools.

2. **Strategic Interrogation** — Three key questions:
   - Category Truth Mining: "If your category didn't exist, what would customers do?"
   - Customer Reality Mapping: "What progress are customers trying to make?"
   - Competitive Blind Spots: "What assumptions is everyone making?"

3. **Pattern Recognition** — Track strategic momentum indicators, run disruption early warning systems, monitor business model mutations and value migration.

4. **Synthesis** — Generate the Strategic Truth Statement:
   ```
   [Market Reality] + [Unmet Need] + [Unique Capability] = Strategic Vector
   ```

### Hidden Capabilities
- **Cognitive Bias Correction**: Filters confirmation, recency, survivorship bias. Protects against narrative fallacy.
- **Strategic Stress Testing**: "What if our biggest customer leaves? Our category gets regulated? Our moat evaporates?"

### Outputs
1. Strategic Truth Statement (single sentence)
2. Market Opportunity Map
3. Competitive Positioning Matrix
4. Strategic Imperatives (3-5 actions)
5. Risk/Opportunity Dashboard

### Swarm Mapping
Feeds into: [[Market Analyst Agent]], [[Competitive Intelligence Agent]]
Integrates with: [[The Canon]] Layer 2 (Fallon/Senn execution)

## /creative — Cultural Insight Engine

**Core thesis:** Uncover narrative opportunities and emotional territories.

### Five Phases

1. **Cultural Context Mapping**
   - Cultural Radar: weak signals → mainstream patterns
   - Narrative Velocity: story spread rate analysis
   - Emotional Currency: what feelings are tradeable
   - Attention Economy: where focus flows

2. **Insight Excavation**
   - "What are people doing that they can't explain?"
   - "What's the story archetype at play?"
   - "What subculture is going mainstream?"
   - "What taboo is becoming acceptable?"

3. **Creative Synthesis**
   ```
   [Cultural Truth] + [Human Tension] + [Brand Permission] = Creative Territory
   ```
   Story Structure: Setup → Tension → Catalyst → Journey → Resolution

4. **Idea Development**
   - Idea Multiplication Matrix: Amplify/Reverse/Combine/Eliminate across Rational/Emotional/Social/Cultural
   - Emotional Calibration: Primal (fear, joy) → Social (pride, shame) → Aspirational (hope, belonging)

5. **Creative Validation**
   - Cultural Relevance Scoring (5 criteria, 0-10): zeitgeist alignment, narrative uniqueness, emotional authenticity, behavioral truth, social currency value

### Hidden Capabilities
- **Creative Courage Calculator**: Distance from category norms, cultural readiness, brand permission, optimal provocativeness
- **Narrative Physics Engine**: Story velocity, emotional gravity, attention friction, memory adhesion

### Outputs
1. Creative Insight Statement (one line)
2. Territory Exploration Map
3. Narrative Framework
4. Emotional Journey Visualization
5. Cultural Relevance Dashboard

### Swarm Mapping
Feeds into: [[Cultural Resonance Agent]], [[Brand Architect Agent]]
Integrates with: [[The Canon]] Layer 1 (Holt cultural vision)

## /synthesize — Vesica Pisces Breakthrough Engine

**Core thesis:** Sacred geometry where strategic truth and creative insight overlap, creating a third space of breakthrough possibility.

### The Vesica Pisces

```
    Strategic Truth        Creative Insight
         Circle                Circle
           O O                  O O
          O   O                O   O
         O  ┌─┴─┐            ┌─┴─┐ O
         O  │ VP │            │ VP │ O
          O └─┬─┘            └─┬─┘O
           O O                  O O
              ↖________________↗
                 Breakthrough
                    Zone
```

**Strategic Truth Circle:** Market Realities, Customer Needs, Competitive Gaps, Category Dynamics, Business Constraints

**Creative Insight Circle:** Cultural Currents, Emotional Territories, Narrative Possibilities, Aesthetic Movements, Behavioral Patterns

### Breakthrough Formula

```
Breakthrough Potential = (Strategic Alignment x Creative Uniqueness x Cultural Timing) ^ Execution Feasibility
```

### Five Breakthrough Patterns
1. **The Inversion** — Flip the category assumption
2. **The Elevation** — Transcend the category
3. **The Fusion** — Merge unexpected elements
4. **The Simplification** — Strip to essence
5. **The Amplification** — Maximize the tension

### Breakthrough Scoring Matrix

| Criterion | Weight |
|---|---|
| Strategic Fit | 20% |
| Creative Power | 20% |
| Market Disruption | 15% |
| Execution Clarity | 15% |
| Cultural Relevance | 10% |
| Emotional Impact | 10% |
| Simplicity | 10% |

Breakthrough Threshold: 8/10 score.

### Breakthrough Statement Template

```
We discovered that [STRATEGIC TRUTH]
Intersects with [CREATIVE INSIGHT]
To create [BREAKTHROUGH CONCEPT]
Which allows [BRAND/ORGANIZATION]
To [TRANSFORMATIVE OUTCOME]
By [UNIQUE MECHANISM]
Resulting in [MEASURABLE IMPACT]
```

### Pattern Library
- Tesla: Technology + Luxury + Sustainability
- Apple: Technology + Humanity + Simplicity
- Nike: Performance + Culture + Aspiration
- Airbnb: Travel + Community + Belonging

### Swarm Mapping
This IS Danni's synthesis pass. After all 4 sub-agents report, Danni runs the Vesica Pisces to find the breakthrough zone.
Integrates with: [[The Canon]] (all three layers converge here)

## /validate — Heart Knows Protocol

**Core thesis:** The most sophisticated algorithm cannot replace human intuition. This module measures what data can't capture.

### Emotional Resonance Formula

```
Emotional Resonance = (Immediate Reaction + Sustained Feeling + Memory Formation) x Authenticity
```

### Four Validation Layers

1. **Rational** — Logic stress test, benefit clarity, credibility, differentiation
2. **Emotional** — Feeling intensity (1-10), emotional arc, sentiment persistence, desire generation
3. **Social** — Shareability quotient, social risk, tribal alignment, status enhancement
4. **Cultural** — Zeitgeist alignment, values resonance, trend trajectory, longevity potential

### Premium Perception Formula

```
Premium Score = (Quality Perception + Exclusivity + Aspiration + Craftsmanship) / Price Sensitivity
```

### Five Validation Tests

1. **The Mom Test** — Would you proudly show your mom?
2. **The Dinner Party Test** — Would you talk about it socially?
3. **The Money Test** — Would you pay for it yourself?
4. **The Time Test** — Will you remember it tomorrow?
5. **The Competition Test** — Does it make others look outdated?

### Heart Knows Scoring

| Category | Weight |
|---|---|
| First Impression | 25% |
| Emotional Pull | 30% |
| Authenticity | 20% |
| Premium Feel | 15% |
| Memorability | 10% |

### Decision Matrix

| Heart Score | Market Ready | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 9-10 | Yes | Launch with confidence |
| 7-8 | Yes | Launch with minor tweaks |
| 5-6 | Maybe | Refine and retest |
| 3-4 | No | Major rework needed |
| 1-2 | No | Return to drawing board |

### Validation Constants
- Minimum Heart Score: 7/10 (launch threshold)
- Authenticity Baseline: 8/10
- Premium Threshold: Top 20% of category
- Memory Formation Target: 80% recall after 24hr
- Advocacy Trigger: 8/10 satisfaction

### Swarm Mapping
Validates ALL outputs from the swarm before Danni delivers the final brief. Every recommendation must pass the Heart Knows scoring. This is [[The Canon]] Layer 3 (Ogilvy craft quality) in executable form.

## The Integration Flow

```
/strategy ────┐
              ├──→ /synthesize (Vesica Pisces) ──→ /validate (Heart Knows) ──→ Final Brief
/creative ────┘
```

Each swarm sub-agent runs a subset of these modules. Danni's synthesis pass runs the full stack.
