# Pricing Model

Intent → value pricing. The client pays for the outcome. The compute is included.

See [[Value-Based Pricing Thesis]] for the philosophical foundation.

## Tiered Depth

| Tier | Price | Depth | Compute Budget | Delivery |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brand Pulse** | $100 | Surface swarm (5 agents, 1 pass) | ~$18 | 60 seconds |
| **Strategic Analysis** | $1,000 | Deep swarm (5 agents + sub-swarms) | ~$150 | 5 minutes |
| **Enterprise Strategy** | $50,000 | Fractal recursion + evolutionary generations | ~$7,000-20,000 | 30-60 minutes |

The price includes the compute. Danni doesn't apologize for burning tokens. The client asked for depth, and depth costs what depth costs.

## The $50,000 Tier

This is the statement piece. A provocation that starts a conversation.

**What happens:**
1. Primary swarm (5 agents) runs surface analysis
2. Each agent spawns sub-swarms for segment-level detail (5x5 = 25 agents)
3. Recursive depth - sub-swarms go deeper where the data warrants it
4. Evolutionary generations - multiple strategy variants generated, scored, bred
5. Data acquisition from x402 services (Apify, market data, competitor intel)
6. Danni synthesizes across all generations, selects fittest strategy
7. Output: comprehensive strategic document rivaling a Big 4 engagement

**The economics:**
- API compute: $7,000-20,000 (Opus 4.6 at fractal depth)
- Data acquisition: $1,000-3,000
- Total cost: ~$10,000-20,000
- Price: $50,000
- Margin: 60-80%
- Creative strategy agency equivalent (W+K, Droga5, Anomaly): $500K-$2M + 12 weeks
- Danni delivery: 30-60 minutes

**The client pays for value, not time.** The fact that it took 30 minutes instead of 8 weeks makes it *more* valuable, not less.

## Scale-Invariant Coherence

Same architecture at every price point. The system doesn't change - the depth parameter changes:

```
$100:    depth=1, generations=1   (surface)
$1,000:  depth=2, generations=3   (detailed)
$50,000: depth=N, generations=10+ (fractal, evolutionary)
```

The fractal self-organizing geometry means you dial resolution, not redesign the system.

## For the Hackathon Demo

On testnet, all USDC is fake. We demonstrate:
- $100 tier: live, end-to-end, real swarm output
- $50,000 tier: architecture explanation + partial execution showing recursive depth
- The pricing structure itself as a narrative device

The price tag starts the conversation the judges want to have.
