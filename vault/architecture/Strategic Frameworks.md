# Strategic Frameworks

Rails for extended thinking. Every token does structural work.

## The Problem

Unstructured "think deeply" prompts burn tokens producing filler. Open-ended LLM reasoning wanders. The output reads like generic analysis.

## The Solution

Each sub-agent in the [[Swarm Architecture]] gets assigned specific thinking frameworks from Seth Godin and [Untools](https://untools.co). The frameworks channel thinking into structured artifacts that become nodes in the semantic web.

## Framework Assignments

### Market Analyst Agent
- **Second-order thinking** (Untools) - What happens after what happens next?
- **Smallest Viable Audience** (Godin) - Who is this market really for?
- Output structure: Assumptions → First-order effects → Second-order effects → Implications

### Competitive Intelligence Agent
- **Inversion** (Untools) - What would guarantee the competitor's failure? What are they avoiding?
- **The Dip** (Godin) - Where are competitors pushing through vs where are they stuck?
- Output structure: Competitor map → Inversion analysis → Dip assessment → Vulnerability matrix

### Cultural Resonance Agent
- **First principles** (Untools) - Strip away cultural assumptions, what's the core human need?
- **Permission Marketing** (Godin) - Does the brand earn attention or demand it?
- Output structure: Cultural signals → First principles decomposition → Permission status → Resonance score

### Brand Architect Agent
- **MECE analysis** (Untools) - Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive positioning options
- **Purple Cow** (Godin) - Is the brand remarkable? What would make it remarkable?
- Output structure: Current positioning → MECE alternatives → Remarkability assessment → Recommended position

### Danni (Synthesis)
- **Recursive semantic webbing** - Connect all nodes, find emergent patterns
- **Confidence calibration** (Untools) - Weight findings by evidence strength
- Output structure: Graph summary → Cross-cutting insights → Confidence-weighted recommendations → Strategic brief

## The Cascade

```
Framework  →  Structured thinking  →  Semantic node  →  Web connection  →  Insight
```

Each agent's output is a **reusable artifact**, not a throwaway response. The semantic web compounds across engagements.

## Why This Matters

1. **Token efficiency** - Frameworks prevent open-ended wandering
2. **Output quality** - Structured > unstructured analysis
3. **Artifact production** - Every call builds the graph
4. **Differentiation** - No other hackathon entry will have this depth
5. **Justifies $100** - The frameworks make the thinking visibly rigorous

## Visualization

The [[glass-box UI]] can show framework application in real-time:
- Agent activates → framework label appears
- Structured output populates → nodes appear in graph
- Cross-agent connections form → edges animate between nodes
- Synthesis completes → the web is the deliverable
