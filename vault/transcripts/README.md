# Session Transcripts

Raw JSONL transcripts from Claude Code sessions. Use for recursive context extraction.

## Sessions

### Session 01: Education & Planning
- **File:** `session-01-education-and-planning.jsonl`
- **Date:** 2026-02-12 ~18:30-19:50 AEST
- **Duration:** ~80 minutes
- **Lines:** 860

**Key decisions made:**
- SvelteKit over Next.js (custom x402 adapter as differentiator)
- $100 premium pricing with swarm intelligence justification
- Dual-chain: Base Sepolia + SKALE via Kobaru
- A2A + MCP + ERC-8004 (all agent interop standards)
- Five parallel teams: Alpha/Bravo/Charlie/Delta/Echo
- LLM provider abstraction (CLI for dev, API for production)
- Apify for real data acquisition via Data Broker
- Danni full personality in commerce context

**Key research completed:**
- x402 SDK architecture deep dive (HTTPAdapter pattern, ~200 lines for SvelteKit)
- All x402 npm packages mapped
- SKALE x402 support confirmed (Kobaru + PayAI facilitators)
- A2A + AP2 + x402 layering understood
- ERC-8004 full spec analyzed (Identity + Reputation + Validation registries)
- Hackathon timeline confirmed (deadline Feb 14 17:59, ~47 hours)
- Sponsor alignment mapped (5 of 6 sponsors covered)

**To extract in recursive pass:**
- Concrete code patterns from x402 adapter research
- Facilitator API contracts
- ERC-8004 Solidity interfaces for deployment
- A2A Agent Card schema details
- MCP server setup patterns from @x402/mcp
- Apify actor selection for each Data Broker endpoint
- Prompt architecture for each swarm sub-agent
