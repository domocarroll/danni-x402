# Sponsor Alignment

How [[Danni Commerce Agent]] hits every sponsor track.

## Sponsor Map

| Sponsor | What They Want | How Danni Hits It | Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SKALE** (Host) | Privacy (BITE), gasless, instant settlement | [[SKALE Network]] integration via Kobaru facilitator, [[BITE Protocol]] narrative | Strong |
| **Coinbase** | x402 pay-per-request/pay-to-use | Core of everything we build. [[x402 Protocol]] throughout. | Very Strong |
| **Google** | Vertex AI, AP2/A2A agent interop | [[A2A Protocol]] Agent Card + task handler, [[AP2 Protocol]] awareness | Strong |
| **Virtuals** | Agent launchpad, ownership models | Danni as a launchable agent with economic model | Medium |
| **Edge & Node** | ampersend wallet, payment dashboards | Payment visualization in glass-box UI | Medium |
| **Vodafone** | Machine-to-machine, IoT payments | Stretch - less natural fit | Weak |

**Score: 5 of 6 sponsors covered.** Vodafone/IoT is the only weak spot.

## Track-Specific Prizes

"Build tracks and individual prize categories will be announced soon" - specific bounty amounts not yet published.

## Strategy

Target **all tracks** with parallel team effort. Even tracks we don't win are valuable infrastructure for the business.
