# Demo Video Strategy

The video IS the product for judges. It matters as much as the code.

## Narrative Arc (3-5 minutes)

### 1. The Problem (10 seconds)
AI agents can't buy or sell services natively. The agentic economy needs a payment layer.

### 2. Meet Danni (20 seconds)
Danni is an autonomous brand strategist. She charges $100 for a premium strategic brief. She pays for her own market data. She's discoverable by any agent on the internet.

### 3. The Demo (2-3 minutes)
- User submits a brand analysis request
- 402 response shown - $100 USDC required
- Payment signed and submitted
- Glass-box view: swarm activating, sub-agents spinning up
- Danni buying data from [[Data Broker]] (sub-payments visible)
- Parallel agent streams converging
- Synthesis happening
- Strategic brief delivered
- On-chain receipt with tx hash
- Show on [[Base Sepolia]] block explorer

### 4. The Architecture (30 seconds)
- First x402 SvelteKit adapter
- Dual-chain: Base + [[SKALE Network]]
- [[A2A Protocol]] + [[MCP Integration]] for agent discovery
- [[Swarm Architecture]] for premium intelligence

### 5. The Future (10 seconds)
This isn't a demo. It's production infrastructure. Any agent can find Danni, pay her, and get genuine strategic intelligence.

## Recording

- OBS for screen capture
- Remotion for post-production (if time allows)
- Record the actual build process as B-roll

## Failure Mitigation

- Cache successful API/Apify responses
- Record demo flow multiple times
- Have fallback data ready
- Status indicators instead of blank screens
