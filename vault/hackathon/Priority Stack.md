# Priority Stack

What survives if time forces cuts. Each level is independently demoable.

## The Stack (Top = Must Ship)

### Level 1: Core Payment Flow
- [[SvelteKit x402 Adapter]] working
- One x402-protected endpoint
- Danni answers a question, payment settles, user gets response + tx hash
- **This alone is a valid submission**

### Level 2: Swarm Intelligence
- [[Swarm Architecture]] producing real multi-agent output
- 5 sub-agents in parallel
- Quality synthesis (not stapled outputs)
- **This is what justifies the $100 price**

### Level 3: Glass-Box Frontend
- SvelteKit chat UI
- Real-time payment flow visualization
- Swarm activity visible
- **This is what wins "Polish & Ship-ability"**

### Level 4: Agent Interop
- [[A2A Protocol]] Agent Card + task handler
- [[MCP Integration]] server
- **This is what wins "Partner Integration"**

### Level 5: Dual-Chain + Data
- [[SKALE Network]] via Kobaru facilitator
- [[Data Broker]] with live Apify data
- [[BITE Protocol]] privacy narrative
- **This is what wins "SKALE" track**

## The Principle

Each level adds to the demo but nothing below depends on anything above. We can cut from the bottom at any time and still have a complete, presentable product.
