# BITE Protocol

Blockchain Integrated Threshold Encryption. SKALE's privacy layer that encrypts transactions before they enter the mempool and decrypts them only after block finalization.

## What It Solves

- Agent payment flows stay private during execution
- Prevents front-running and MEV extraction
- Balances, intent, and strategy are hidden until finality
- Provides commerce-grade privacy without breaking on-chain verifiability

## Why It Matters For Danni

"Danni's strategic consultations are encrypted until settlement."

When Danni buys competitive intelligence from the [[Data Broker]], those transactions are invisible to observers until they're settled. This means:
- Competitors can't see what data Danni is buying
- The strategic analysis process is confidential
- Payment amounts and patterns are private

This is the **privacy narrative** for the [[SKALE Network]] integration and a differentiator for the [[Hackathon Strategy|hackathon]].
